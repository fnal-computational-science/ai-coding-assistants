# AI Coding Assistant Ecosystem Diagrams

## High-Level Relationships (UML)

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class IDE {
       
    }
    class AIAssistant {
      
    }
    class CLITool {
       
    }
    class AIModel {
   
    }
    class InteractionMode {
    
    }

    IDE --> AIAssistant : API services
    CLITool --> AIAssistant : API services
    CLITool --> AIModel : prompt orchestration 
    AIAssistant --> AIModel : prompt orchestration
    AIAssistant --> InteractionMode : expose capabilities
    InteractionMode --> IDE : in-IDE UX
    InteractionMode --> CLITool : text-based UX
```

The original, all-in-one diagram has been split into three focused Mermaid views for clarity:

- [`ai_ide.md`](./ai_ide.md) — IDE-centric integrations with AI coding assistants and their underlying models (no editors or CLI tooling).
- [`ai_editors.md`](./ai_editors.md) — Notebook and lightweight editor experiences powered by AI assistants.
- [`ai_cli.md`](./ai_cli.md) — Command-line tooling that surfaces AI assistance directly in the terminal, plus the supporting services and models.

Open any of the files above in VS Code (Markdown preview) or the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to render the diagrams individually. This layout keeps each context scoped and accessible while still covering the full ecosystem across the three documents.
