## Installation

These instructions are written for someone working on a laptop or desktop on which you have permission to install code.
From this machine, you may log into a remote machine to do code development, or you may build and run code locally on the machine.

If you do not already have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) installed, install it.
During the installation it will ask you to set up Copilot and prompt you to log in to your GitHub account.
You must already have a GitHub account established.
Through you GitHub account, you can enable GitHub Copilot features; go to https://github.com/settings/copilot/features, which will direct you to your own account's settings.

If you do not already have it, install the GitHub Copilot extension. [^orig]
In VS Code, in the left-hand sidebar, choose "Extensions" (the icon for "Extensions" is shown in @fig-extensions; the Copilot extension is circled in red. Your sidebar may show additional extensions you have already installed some).

[^orig]: VS Code may have prompted you to set up Copilot when you first started it.
         If you have done that, you already have the extension and it is properly configured.

When you are editing code, you may choose to work *locally* or *remotely*.
Working locally means the code you are editing, and for compiled languages the builds you are creating reside on your laptop or deskotp.
Working remotely means the code you are editing and for compiled language the builds you are creating reside on a remote (typically Linux) machine.
